## Motivation


## Objective
Using Keras library utilities, applied transfer learning via pre-trained VGG16 convolutional Neural Network model to classify artwork from 16 graffiti artists.
Train a model that predicts the artist based on an unseen sample graffiti artwork.
## Methodology



## Results
### Top-1 Accuracy
The best Top-1 accuracy score was 0.55 for the baseline model. The configurations for the base line model is as follows: 
- No image augmentation
- 2 Dense Layers
- batch size = 20
- Drop out = 0.5
- RMSprop Optimizer

The following hyperparameters tunning did not improve the Top-1 Test accuracy score of the baseline model.
- Dense units of 128, dense units of 512
- Drop out of 0.25, drop out of 0.60
- Optimizer Adam and SGD
- Adding a dense layer

### Top-3 Accuracy
A more realistic performance metric to consider is Top-3 Accuracy for the baseline model. The Top-3 Accuracy result was 0.77.
