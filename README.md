[![Mock up app icon](/images/G4.jpeg)](https://youtu.be/txwfqmuV4MQ)


Using Keras library utilities, applied transfer learning via pre-trained VGG16 convolutional Neural Network model to classify artwork from 16 graffiti artists.
Train a model that predicts the artist based on an unseen sample graffiti artwork.
