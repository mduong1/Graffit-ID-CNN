## Motivation


## Objective
Using Keras library utilities, applied transfer learning via pre-trained VGG16 convolutional Neural Network model to classify artwork from 16 graffiti artists.
Train a model that predicts the artist based on an unseen sample graffiti artwork.

## Methodology



## Results
### Top-1 Accuracy
The best Top-1 accuracy score was 55% for the baseline model. The configurations for the base line model is as follows: 
- No image augmentation
- 2 Dense Layers
- Batch size = 20
- Drop out = 0.5
- RMSprop Optimizer

The following hyperparameters tunning did not improve the Top-1 Test accuracy score from the baseline model.
- Dense units of 128, dense units of 512
- Drop out of 0.25, drop out of 0.60
- Optimizer Adam, SGD
- Adding a dense layer

### Top-3 Accuracy
A more realistic performance metric to use is Top-3 Accuracy for the baseline model. The model predictions falls in the top three values 77% of the time.

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix not only helped to easily see where the model was right and wrong but it gave insight into the relationship between various artists. It's clear as to why the model did a good job of correctly predicting for the artists Daim, Keith Haring, Retna and Roa. All four artists style of art is singular whether it's all wild animals for Roa, Keith Haring's mostly bold outlines of figures or only bold hieroglyphs and calligraphy by Retna. The model was understandbly mixed up between Banksy and Ble le Rat. Further investigation revealed that Banksy was inspired by Blek le Rat and thus both share visual similaity to their pieces. The model completely misclassified Futura2000 due to his wide ranging art style.
